    <p>I am an undergraduate mathematics student at the <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/">Australian National University</a> with broad interests, but have recently spent some time doing equivariant stable homotopy theory. </p>

Here is my [CV](./CV.pdf).

### Honours Thesis

My [thesis](./thesis.pdf) was supervised by Dr. <a href="https://maths.anu.edu.au/people/academics/vigleik-angeltveit/">Vigleik Angeltveit</a>, and gives a complete algebraic description of the homotopy Mackey functors of the equivariant Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum HF_2 over the Klein four-group.
