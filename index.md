    <p>I am a fifth year graduate student in mathematics at Northwestern, advised by <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/getzler/">Ezra Getzler</a>. I am interested in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry. Currenty, I am thinking about cobordism theory and intersection theory on the moduli space of curves. </p>
