      I am a fifth year graduate student in mathematics at Northwestern, advised by <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/getzler/">Ezra Getzler</a>.
      I am interested in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry. Currently, I am thinking about
      cobordism and intersection theory on the moduli space of curves.
