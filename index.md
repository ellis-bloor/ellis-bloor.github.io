I am an undergraduate mathematics student at the Australian National University with broad interests, but have recently spent some time doing equivariant stable homotopy theory.

Here is my [CV](./CV.pdf).

### Honours Thesis

My [thesis](./thesis.pdf) was supervised by Dr. Vigleik Angeltveit, and gives a complete algebraic description of the homotopy Mackey functors of the equivariant Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum HF_2 over the Klein four-group.

### Expository Writings

* [The local Atiyah-Singer index theorem over four-manifolds](./Atiyah-Singer_index_theorem.pdf)
* [Yang-Mills theory on Riemann surfaces](./Yang-Mills_Riemann_surfaces.pdf)
