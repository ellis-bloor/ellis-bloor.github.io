I am an undergraduate mathematics student at the Australian National University with broad interests, but have spent some time recently in equivariant stable homotopy theory.

Here is my [CV](./CV.pdf).

### Honours Thesis

My [thesis](./thesis.pdf) was supervised by Dr. [Vigleik Angeltveit](./https://maths.anu.edu.au/people/academics/vigleik-angeltveit), and gives a complete algebraic description of the homotopy Mackey functors of the equivariant Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum HF_2 over the Klein four-group.
